# TextBasedAdventure
CISP360 (Introduction to Structured Programming w/ C++) - Final Project

We were tasked with coding a text-based adventure game that utilized fundamental concepts we learned throughout the semester (Looping, Modularization, Structs, etc.).

I chose to center mine on the world of Tolkien (a no-brainer due to my love for 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit'). In this short adventure, you - the player - will embark on a journey to defeat the dragon Smaug and take his treasure. This game includes a turn-based battle system with randomly generated battles and scripted boss fights.
